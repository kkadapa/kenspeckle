If an individual is driven by curiosity, it is obvious that he/she would explore prominent places in a particular location; for instance, I am standing near to Bull’s statue which is in Wall Street-New York and looking for good famous places being a new comer to the city. I would love to have an app handy on my phone which pulls out a list of prominent places to visit nearby that area based on the exact location of phone.
Isn’t that great???
One would feel relaxed and wise by looking at that list, perfect word for that feeling is awe-struck;
